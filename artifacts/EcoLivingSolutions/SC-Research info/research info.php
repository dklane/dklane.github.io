All the research we want has to do with homeowners including more green and clean energy in their home.
NOTE: The TSA guidelines give us the Environmental Protection Agency as a potential source. This is a US based agency so they probably want us to look at this from an American viewpoint
  
get stuff for:
    Basic information about green energy
        Green energy is energy generated from natural, basically infinite resources, such as sunlight, wind, or water. 
  
    Cost of switching to green energy
        As fossil fuels start to decrease, the demand will increase, meaning a rise in prices and a drop in availability. 
  
    Tax rebates for green energy products. ex: solar panels
    Good practices for saving energy
  
difference between Clean energy, Green energy, and renewable energy.
  Clean energy is essentially clean air.
  Green energy is not harmful to the environment
  Renewable energy is energy that is naturally replenished, like the solar power and wind powered

clean energy does produce electricity without emissions. ex. a hydroelectric plant must be placed near a river, meaning the natural environment nearby will have to be cleared out, all the while the work to build a hydroelectric plant will release emissions.

  UK and US are aiming to reach net zero by 2050, using electricity from renewable sources is essential to help reduce our carbon emmissions. 
  
in 2020 Britain reached a milestone for a large population nation being largely powered by clean energy for an entire year.
