It is an honor to work with the staff and students at Bryan Station. 
I graduated from Bryan Station many years ago. After working as a programmer 
and team lead at IBM, Lexmark, and Mathworks, it has been fun returning 
as a teacher to serve the next generation.
Our school has many excellent programs and I am excited to be part of our
<a href="https://bshs.fcps.net/academies/information-technology-academy">Information Technology Academy</a>.

My [courses](courses) include 
[Computer Literacy](complit),
[Computational Thinking](compthink),
[Introduction to Programming](introprog),
and [AP Computer Science A](csa). 
I expect the students in these courses to learn useful skills
and earn [industry certifications](certifications).

Student access these courses on [Canvas](http://fcps.net/canvas).

I also host or assist the following clubs:

* [Beta Club](https://sites.google.com/stu.fayette.kyschools.us/bshsbeta/)
* [Hiking Club](https://bshs.fcps.net/students/clubs/hiking-club)
* [Game Club](https://bshs.fcps.net/students/clubs/game-club)
* [E-Sports](https://www.playvs.com/high-school)
* [Cyberpatriots](https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/)
* [Technology Student Association (TSA)](https://tsaweb.org/tsa)
