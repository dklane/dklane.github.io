If you plan to study engineering at a university in Kentucky, ask me about the [Transition to Engineering (T2E)](https://engr.uky.edu/academics/undergraduate-studies/first-year-engineering-program/transition-engineering-program) program! T2E takes the UK wildly successful First-Year Engineering (FYE) program required of all incoming engineering students and applies it at the high school level. Doug Klein, FYE lecturer and well-known educator within the Kentucky public school system not only directs the program but also trains the teachers who facilitate T2E in their classrooms.

We participate in the US Air Force [CyberPatriot](https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/home) competiton. All students are invited to join a team.

Our students also have access to Google's IT Support Certificate curriculum through through [Grow with Google](https://grow.google/certificates/).
